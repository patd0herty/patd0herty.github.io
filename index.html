            <p>
                My Name is Patrick Doherty, I am a recently graduated Game Design & Development major at RIT. I have always had a very math oriented brain and have been interested in computers and programming from a young age, combine that with a love of games and storytelling and it was only a matter of time before I would explore game design as a career. 
                Throughout my time here at RIT I have worked on many different projects learning valuable lessons in team work, iterative design, and AGILE development practices. While at RIT I have learned C#, C++, Unity WebGL, Unity Mobile Games, I have also published a game on the Google Play Store.

            <p> Since a very young age I have known I was interested in creating games. I've spent many years learning about coding and the development process. I have an extensive history with Tabletop Roleplaying Games developing adventures and creating stories with many different people. I even work with a charity running Roleplaying Games to children to teach them social and problem solving skills, <a href="https://www.heroesjourneyinc.org">The Heroes Journey Inc.</a></p>

Play as a "Party Phoenix" as you compete against your friends to light up the sky during the festival of flames.

                        In this project I worked as part of a team of eight to develop this game demo as part of Production Studio class at RIT. I worked on various different systems in the game such as temporarily saving player loadouts, basic player controls, menu interactions and the map system.

                    <p>An isometric Hack 'n Slash game set in a Cyberpunk City. "In Neon Shadows, you are a Shadow Runner navigating the dangerous streets of Neon City.

                        I worked as a Gameplay Programmer in a team of 4. Primarily working on the player and all of its mechanics including melee and range attacks, dash mechanics and a basic 3 hit combo attack. Additionally I was able to practice my level design skills by designing the tutorial level. This project took place over 3 months as part of a "Production Studio" class at RIT.
